# password-generator

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a generated password randomly based on the user's criteria. The criteria includes but not limited to: numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. 

With JavaScript, I have created a series of prompts that will ask the user their desired length and type of characters for their password. With their choices, the generator selects the array that includes the user's desired type of character to be included into their password. Using a for loop, we use Math.floor() and Math.random() within the loop in order to have a random character be selected from the array of choice to be added to the new password until it reaches the desired length.
